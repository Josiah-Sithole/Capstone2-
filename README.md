# Shopping Cart ðŸ›’ 
 This project is a functional shopping cart created using Html, CSS and JavaScript. 
 It allows the user to add and remove products in a shopping cart without the need to go back to the home page. 
 This shopping cart was created with the aim of learning JavaScript functions and how to make pages functional and interactive. 
 It was created as an online shop  that is user friendly and helps those who struggle to order gadgets online since the information and details provided in the project are         straight forward. 
 The project shows gadgets from a local brand J-Sithy created by the owner Josiah Sithole, and the prices are random numbers used.
